## The Journey So Far / How The App Works
-According to the NYC Department of Planning, over 3 million of New York City’s residents are foreign-born - and half of all New Yorkers speak at least one language other than English at home.<br>
-As of 2010 - over 771,000 New Yorkers are aged 5 or younger - that’s roughly 10% of the entire NYC population (!!!) - and that number is only expected to rise as we approach the end of this decade.<br>
-Limited access to information about Universal Pre-K is a problem for our city, because according to landmark observational studies like the HighScope Perry Preschool Study, children who participate in early childhood education are more likely to graduate high school, and less likely get arrested, or spend time in prison than those who do not.<br>
-Immigrant families have the added concern of a possible language barrier in gaining access to quality Preschool education, when searching for useful information. Although NYC.Gov has made efforts to share this infomation, many immigrant families might not know how best to identify their nearest location.<br>
## ResourcED™ NYC  fills the gap between resources and families, as the application:
-Is Mobile (can be used anywhere)<br>
-Is Easy to Use (just a few clicks will get a user what they need)<br>
-Is Singularly-Focused (no worry of being lost in the weeds of a misguided Google Search)<br>
-Utilizes approved, regularly updated, openly available NYC Data Sets<br>
-Takes advantage of a mobile device’s language settings (with instructions displayed in multiple languages)<br>

## The Future
-Integrate more resources  (UPK, Child-care locations, After-School programs, etc)<br>
-Integration of a “Favorites List” - a collection of programs selected by the user for further investigation at a later date<br>
-Add more language translations (Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, etc.)
